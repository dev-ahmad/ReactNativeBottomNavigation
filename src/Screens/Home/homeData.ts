        info: "One summer morning a couple of years ago, a passerby took photos of three young women bathing in the Fontanone dell’Acqua Paola, the 17th-century fountain on the Janiculum Hill in a quiet part of Rome. Almost immediately the snapshots were posted on @TrastevereRM, the popular Twitter account that promotes the city’s cultural and artistic traditions. The commentary was indignant: “It’s very hot, but the Janiculum fountain should not be treated as a swimming pool by the tourists. Rome deserves more respect!” A few days later, this episode was reported in The Local, an English-language news agency specializing in domestic coverage. “Rome residents have reacted angrily after three tourists were snapped frolicking in one of their city’s historic fountains while wearing bikinis and swimsuits.” 1"

        info: "Kipnis had a point: in Jakarta, geometries inundate you. All manner of stacked boxes, saddled peaks, and elliptical extrusions crowd the skyline of Indonesia’s capital, while throughout the city below there spreads a constant fractal surface of informal settlement. Tower designs that look like leftovers from other hyper-expansive cities seem to wash up here, at the ebb-tide of a few civilizations, like gargantuan discarded water bottles."

        info: "Robin Boyd (1919–1971) would surely be pleased to see himself profiled in this Places series. Naturally he would be less happy to see himself framed as partially forgotten in the 50 odd years since his death — but he would feel rightfully placed amongst the stellar critics and historians who were his peers. Boyd was enormously ambitious for the possibilities of architecture and, as an advocate for his profession, he sought influence on the world stage. Given that he was Australian, and given our powerful national culture of self-apology (to which I will return), this was a bold plan. But he actually came close to realizing his grand vision; at the least, he is certainly the most famous and influential architecture critic this country has ever produced. He has the unique distinction of having been accepted, in the words of his biographer Geoffrey Serle, as “Australian architecture’s chief spokesperson,” a role which no one else has held before or since. 1"

        info: "The new capital of Egypt has no residents. It doesn’t have a local source of water. It just lost a major developer, the Chinese state company that had agreed to build the first phase. You might say the planned city in the desert 45 kilometers east of Cairo doesn’t have a reason to exist. Urban planner David Sims told the Wall Street Journal, “Egypt needs a new capital like a hole in the head.” 1"

        info: "At the dawn of the Jet Age, in 1962, President John F. Kennedy strode across the red-carpeted tarmac of the Mexico City Central Airport into the arms of President Adolfo López Mateos for a traditional abrazo. It was JFK’s third state visit to Latin America, as he built support for his pan-hemispheric social and economic cooperation plan, the Alliance for Progress. Between all the standard stops — an honorary luncheon at the National Palace, a bilateral meeting at the Mexican presidential residence — his hosts squeezed in a tour of a massive new housing complex, Unidad Independencia, on the southern outskirts of the capital."

        info: "The talent the geological sciences have for placing humans on unfathomable time lines — in which human history appears as little more than a gracious footnote to forces too powerful to measure and too slow to watch — seems to be exercised less and less as images of melting glaciers and exponential curves produce a very different kind of feeling. … The image of the city, in particular, as a thing that is made of geology or on geology, increasingly has to contend with the idea of the city as a thing that makes geology."
